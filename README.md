## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! (Apple Products)

**File:** `apple_products.py`

### Description:
- **Classes & Inheritance:**  
  - Defines an `AppleProduct` base class with attributes such as model name, storage capacity, color, price, and operating system.
  - Implements subclasses: `iPhone`, `iPad`, and `MacBook`, each with additional attributes and unique behavior methods (e.g., `take_photo`, `draw`, and `run_application`).
- **Examples:**  
  - The script creates 10 examples of different Apple products:
    - *iPhones:* iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone SE, iPhone 14 Pro.
    - *iPads:* iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini.
    - *MacBooks:* MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13, MacBook Pro 16.
- **CSV Output:**  
  - Product details are saved to `data/apple_products.csv` for record-keeping.
